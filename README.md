# Overview
This library implements classic motion planning algorithms for autonoumous system in Python.

## Thoughts
- connect with CARLA/ROS?
- connect with Apollo?

## Algorithms

```text
- path-planning
    - grid-based
    - sampling-based
- motion-planning
    - hybrid-astar-planner
    - lattice-planner
```


## TODO
- [] implement gif generator
